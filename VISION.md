# üöÄ Vision: Minecraft AI City Builder

## Overview

The *Minecraft AI City Builder* project is an ambitious initiative to develop a fully autonomous, AI-driven system that can interpret natural language prompts and translate them into rich, dynamic, and scalable Minecraft structures and cities. The long-term goal is to blur the lines between creativity, automation, and spatial reasoning within virtual worlds, enabling both gamers and developers to generate complex environments with simple commands.

## üåç Goals

### Short-Term
- Build a working AI bot that autonomously flattens terrain, constructs diverse structures, and logs tasks.
- Enable natural language interaction using commands like `//build a stone house with windows`.
- Create a 10,000-prompt ‚Üí command dataset for fine-tuning local LLMs.
- Offer a local-first, offline-capable experience powered by Ollama and Whisper for transcription.
- Allow users to run the AI bot via a single BAT script (`Minecraft_start.bat`).
- Provide full open-source access and documentation to support grant review and community expansion.

### Mid-Term
- Add support for different structure types: gothic towers, modern bridges, castles, cathedrals, mines, redstone railroads, and more.
- Train a custom fine-tuned model based on in-game construction examples, using user commands and real-world mappings.
- Enable AI vision to let the bot recognize terrain and previously built structures.
- Support persistent map state and zone-based expansion for structured, non-overlapping city growth.

### Long-Term
- Integrate real-world coordinate mapping using APIs like Google Maps to replicate real cities (e.g., New York, Chicago, etc.) inside Minecraft.
- Develop an AI pipeline that uses terrain data and street layouts to generate accurate, themed cityscapes.
- Allow players or educators to prompt the AI with commands like:
  - `//build a replica of Times Square`
  - `//build a Gothic cathedral in the northwest quadrant`
  - `//terraform the area to match Richmond, VA downtown`
- Explore future commercialization or educational licensing by offering curated datasets, city templates, or downloadable expansions.
- Expand platform compatibility beyond Minecraft Java Edition to reach Bedrock and modded servers.

## ü§ñ Innovation

This project pushes the boundaries of:
- AI integration with voxel-based worldbuilding
- Real-time command parsing and execution
- Spatial logic and terrain awareness
- Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning and inference for game environments

---

## üìà Use Cases

- **Education**: Teach architecture, logic, and city planning using Minecraft + AI prompts.
- **Gaming**: Enhance creative freedom in sandbox worlds without complex building tools.
- **Research**: Serve as a testbed for AI vision, planning, and autonomous execution in virtual environments.
- **Urban Simulation**: Recreate real-world city layouts for testing, planning, or digital storytelling.

---

## üå± Sustainability

- Built on open standards and freely available models (DeepSeek, Gemma, etc.)
- Focused on edge and offline capabilities to reduce cloud compute dependence
- Designed for low-maintenance operation with logs and task recovery

## üìå Conclusion

Minecraft AI City Builder is not just a mod ‚Äî it‚Äôs a proof-of-concept for what AI-assisted world generation could look like across games, education, and simulation. This project has the potential to scale from personal creativity tools to broader city modeling and LLM research applications.
